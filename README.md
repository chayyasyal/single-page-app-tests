# Single Page App tests

Here I have used Javascript and HTML to create small practice tests that will be used as single page applications

# Method

I have used a HTML file to structure my SPA. These are in body and script tags. The hashtags in an
SPA are used to map out different parts of the app without refreshing or changing the browswer.
Usually we use a '/' to tell the code to navigate us (the user) to another URL, but, in this task
the hashtags do that for us.
